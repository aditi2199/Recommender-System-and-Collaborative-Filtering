# Recommender-System-and-Collaborative-Filtering
Implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and applied it to a dataset of movie ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The low  rank matrix factorization stores the dataset, contains the number of users and number of movies where user gives rating to the  movie. A function for computation of collaborative filtering is built for the prediction of movie ratings for the movies that are not  rated by the user which will allow us to recommend the highest rated movies to the user. 
This Project is made through the distance learning program or course offered by Coursera and contained partially solved codes.
The project is a part of course on coursera i.e. Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford University
